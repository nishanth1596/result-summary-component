## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

1. **Implement responsive design**: The challenge allowed me to practice using media queries and flexible layouts like Flexbox to ensure the page looks great across different screen sizes.
2. **Work with CSS gradients**: I used linear gradients to style the background elements, learning how to properly apply multiple gradient colors in a seamless way.
3. **Font management**: I integrated custom fonts from Google Fonts and made sure they were applied correctly across different screen sizes.

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing more complex layout techniques, especially working with Flexbox and Grid. I also aim to improve my skills in optimizing images for the web.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs - Flexbox - This documentation helped me understand Flexbox better.
Google Fonts - I used the Outfit font from Google Fonts to style the text.
